### Getting Started

#### Dependencies
The project is not live and will need to be pulled down and opened on your local device. 

#### Execution

##### Generate a Recipe! 
- To generate a recipe select one of the four options, press the **Let's Cook** button, wait a few seconds and your recipe will appear!
- You can select sides, desserts or main dish for one dish or select entire meal and get a radom combination of all 3! 

### Future Additions
In the future, we hope to do the following:
- A login page for users to input their name.
- The ability for users to create, save and delete their own dishes. 
- Local storage so users recipes persist into the future. 

### Growth Oppurtunities
- I took on a bit more than I could chew with the intermediate CSS. I could have chosen an easier iteration to implement and tackled more challenging iterations if I desired to afterwards. 
- CSS and Html are still very daunting for me. I found it challenging to stay organized and focused. In future projects I think it would benefit me to pick a system for using flexboxes and really try to stick to it. 
- Similarly with Html I need to find a naming convention for classes and Ids that is easy to understand and implementable for a variety of projects. 

### Wins 
- I got my cookpot to spin! 
- I used several new techniques and methods like **eval()** to build my functions.
